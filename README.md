## Analytics ActionService

The [Janet](https://github.com/techery/janet) ActionService handles analytics events in a descriptive and command-based way throughout your project.

### Motivation

Usually, the analytics SDK (Adobe, Google's Firebase, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) expects to receive the data in a predefined format, which differs between libraries. It brings about several complexities:

 * ❗️ switching between various analytics service vendors is difficult and error-prone requiring a lot of monotonous work
 * ❗️ using two or more analytics SDKs in one project can give you a headache, as it implies a lot of boilerplate code
 * ❗️ your analytics data source and SDK are likely to have a totally different structure forcing you to place somewhere your code that collects data and organizes it into a suitable format

##### Typical issue

Imagine that you have a user interaction with some data logging:

```java
public class PetBuyPresenter {

	@Inject SomeAnalyticsSdk analyticsSdk;
	...
	public void onPetBuyButtonClick(PetEntity pet) {
		...
		analyticsSdk.sendEvent(pet); // <-- problem
	}
}
```

The problem is the `SomeAnalyticsSdk.sendEvent()` method doesn't accept our entity directly. Instead, it requires `String eventName` and `Map<String, String> eventData`. On top of that, `PetEntity` has a number of characteristics stored as `int`s and `String`s and, of cource, a `Date birthDate` field.

You can write some code to reformat our data and feed it to the `sendEvent` method. But!

 * ⚠️ What if the reformatting code grows with time and takes up more and more space in your presenter?
 * ⚠️ What if we have some other presenter to send a similar event?
 * ⚠️ Testing the reformatting logic as part of the presenter might be difficult or impossible for a number of reasons.

##### Solution example

This library helps you overcome these complexities the way shown below. It allows to:

 * ✅ quickly add/remove events for multiple SDKs along with new SDKs
 * ✅ reuse analytics event/data conversion code
 * ✅ extract the analytics data from the business/view logic
 * ✅ isolate the analytics data convertion
 * ✅ cover the analytics data convertion with unit tests

```java
public class PetBuyPresenter {

	@Inject Janet janet;    
    
	public void onPetBuyButtonClick(PetEntity pet) {
		...
	        janet.createPipe(PetBuyEvent.class)
                    .send(new PetBuyEvent(pet)); // no problem here
    	}
}
```
The `PetBuyEvent` class knows how to reformat the data from `PetEntity` to something that the analytics SDK expects. It can be tested as a single unit, it can collect some other data to enrich the analytics event (e.g. adds info about the user that bought a pet), and it can be reused from some other presenter as-is.

### Usage

##### 1. Setup tracker

Create the implementation of the `Tracker` interface for the particular analytics SDK:

```java
public class SomeAnalyticsTracker implements Tracker {

    public static final String ID = "SomeAnalyticsSdkTrackerId";
    private final SomeAnalyticsSdk sdk;

    public SomeAnalyticsTracker() {
        sdk = new SomeAnalyticsSdk();
    }

    @Override
    public String id() {
        return ID;
    }

    @Override
    public void trackEvent(String actionKey, Map<String, Object> data) {
        sdk.sendEvent(actionKey, prepareData(data));
    }

    private Map<String, String> prepareData(Map<String, Object> data) {
        // final transformation - this will be special for any Tracker implementation
        // while Map<String, Object> is a more general contract.
        // E.g. you can put Integer or Boolean as a map item value
    }
}
```

##### 2. Setup Janet

```java
Collection<Tracker> trackers = Arrays.asList(new SomeAnalyticsTracker());
ActionService actionService = new AnalyticsService(trackers);
Janet janet = new Janet.Builder().addService(actionService).build();
```

##### 3. Create a class for the analytics event

```java
@AnalyticsEvent(actionKey = "user_bought_pet:$action_key_param", trackerIds = { SomeAnalyticsTracker.ID })
public class BuyPetEvent {

    @KeyPath("action_key_param")
    String petType;

    @Attribute("pet_birth_date")
    String petBirthDate;

    @AttributeMap
    Map<String, Object> data = new HashMap<>();

    public BuyPetEvent(PetEntity petEntity) {
        petType = petEntity.petType.name().toLowerCase(Locale.US);
        petBirthDate = DateFormat.getDateInstance().format(petEntity.birthDate);
        data.put("pet_name", petEntity.name);
    }
}
```

The `@AnalyticsEvent` annotation flags a class as the one to be processed by `AnalyticsService` providing the info:

 * `actionKey` - an event name. Different analytics SDKs all have the param tag of this kind for every event;
 * `trackerIds` - an array of trackers' identifiers where this action should be processed.

Annotations for class fields:

 * `@KeyPath` – use this annotation if you want to format your `actionKey` at runtime
 * `@Attribute` - the annotation `value` and field value will form a key-value pair in the `data` map that the tracker recieves
 * `@AttributeMap` – sometimes, it might be easier to form a map than to create a [big] number of annotated fields. These map contents will be merged with attributes.

For more info please see the `sample` project code.
For more sophisticated janet-usage please see the samples from [Janet repo](https://github.com/techery/janet) and Janet's [CommandActionService](https://github.com/techery/janet-command)

#### Additional features

 * `Kotlin` is supported
 * Testable, refer to [sample tests](sample/src/test/java/io/techery/analytics/sample)

#### Limitations

 * If event classes involve inheritance, only the bottom-most inheritor's instance can be sent to the service.
 * Event classes should not declare annotated fields as `private` - default visibility is applicable.

#### Advanced bits

 * In a multi-module project using the javac option `'-Ajanet.analytics.module.library=true'` is a **must**, while in the main module (e.g. your typical Android project `:app` module) this parameter should not be specified.
